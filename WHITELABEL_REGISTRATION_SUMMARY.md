# 🎯 Multi-Tenant White-Label System Implementation Summary

## 🔍 System Architecture Redesign

Your Extended Warranty Management system has been completely transformed into a **sophisticated multi-tenant white-label platform** with:

### 🏗️ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
1. **Main Company**: Your primary company that creates and manages all white-label companies
2. **White-Label Companies**: Independent warranty providers with complete isolation from each other
3. **Cross-Company Access**: Main company can work across all white-labels for support and management

### 👥 **Enhanced User Type System**
- **Main Company Users**: `MAIN_OWNER`, `MAIN_EMPLOYEE`, `MAIN_SUPPORT_EMPLOYEE`
- **White-Label Users**: `WHITELABEL_OWNER`, `WHITELABEL_EMPLOYEE`, `WHITELABEL_SUPPORT_EMPLOYEE`
- **Legacy Sales Hierarchy**: Maintained for compatibility (TSM → ASM → Sales → Distributors → Retailers)

### 🔐 **Dynamic Support Employee Permissions**
- **Configurable Permission Sets**: Support employees get assigned specific permission sets
- **Assignment-Based Access**: Support employees can only access assigned companies/users
- **Strict Key Restrictions**: Support employees **CANNOT** transfer, allocate, or revoke keys
- **Audit Trail**: All support employee actions tracked with proper attribution

## ✅ Solution Components Implemented

### 🚀 Setup Scripts (To Be Created)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup-main-company": "node scripts/setup-main-company.js",
    "create-whitelabel": "node scripts/create-whitelabel.js",
    "manage-permissions": "node scripts/manage-permissions.js",
    "list-companies": "node scripts/list-companies.js"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ How the New System Works

### Step 1: Initialize Main Company (One-time)

```bash
npm run setup-main-company
```

**Creates:**
- Main company with `MAIN` type
- Main owner user with `MAIN_OWNER` type  
- Initial key allocation (default: 10,000 keys)
- Cross-company access structure

### Step 2: Create White-Label Companies

```bash
npm run create-whitelabel
```

**For each white-label:**
- Independent company with `WHITELABEL` type
- White-label owner with `WHITELABEL_OWNER` type
- Isolated key allocation and user hierarchy
- Complete data isolation from other white-labels

### Step 3: Set Up Support Employees

```bash
# Create permission sets
npm run manage-permissions create

# Assign support employees  
npm run manage-permissions assign

# Create company assignments
npm run manage-permissions assign-company
```

### Step 4: Verify Security Restrictions

Support employees should **FAIL** these operations:
- Key allocation/transfer/revocation ❌
- Access to unassigned companies ❌
- Actions without proper permissions ❌

## 🏗️ New Architecture Features

### ✅ **Multi-Tenant Isolation**
- **Company Separation**: White-labels cannot access each other's data
- **Data Isolation**: Complete customer and user data separation
- **Independent Operations**: Each white-label operates independently

### ✅ **Enhanced Security & Permissions**
- **Dynamic Support Permissions**: Configurable permission sets for support staff
- **Key Operation Restrictions**: Support employees cannot perform ANY key operations
- **Assignment-Based Access**: Support employees only access assigned resources
- **Cross-Company Control**: Main company manages access to white-labels

### ✅ **Support Employee Management**
- **Permission Sets**: Pre-defined permission configurations
- **Company Assignments**: Assign support to specific white-label companies
- **User Assignments**: Assign support to specific users and their subordinates
- **Hierarchy Assignments**: Access to users up to certain hierarchy levels

### ✅ **Comprehensive Audit System**
- **On-Behalf-Of Tracking**: When support acts on behalf of users
- **Cross-Company Actions**: Main company actions on white-labels
- **Permission Changes**: All permission assignments and modifications
- **Key Operations**: Enhanced key operation tracking with restrictions

## 🔧 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Initialize the main company (one-time)
npm run setup-main-company

# 2. Create your first white-label company
npm run create-whitelabel

# 3. Set up support employee permissions
npm run manage-permissions create --template customer-support

# 4. Assign support employee to white-label
npm run manage-permissions assign-company --support-id USER_123 --company-id WL_456

# 5. Start the API server
npm run dev

# 6. Access API documentation
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/docs
```
