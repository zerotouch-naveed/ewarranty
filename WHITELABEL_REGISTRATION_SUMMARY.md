# 🎯 Whitelabel Registration Solution Summary

## 🔍 Problem Identified

Your Extended Warranty Management system had a **chicken and egg problem**:

1. **Creating companies** required admin privileges (TSM/ASM users)
2. **Registering users** required an existing `companyId` 
3. **No initial company or admin** existed to bootstrap the system

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've created a comprehensive whitelabel registration system with **3 automated scripts**:

### 📁 Files Created

```
scripts/
├── bootstrap.js              # Initialize system with first company & admin
├── register-whitelabel.js    # Interactive whitelabel company registration
└── list-companies.js         # View all companies and their details

WHITELABEL_SETUP.md           # Complete setup and usage guide
WHITELABEL_REGISTRATION_SUMMARY.md  # This summary
```

### 🚀 Scripts Added to package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "bootstrap": "node scripts/bootstrap.js",
    "register-whitelabel": "node scripts/register-whitelabel.js", 
    "list-companies": "node scripts/list-companies.js"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ How to Register Whitelabels

### Step 1: Initialize System (One-time)

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

**Creates:**
- Main company with 10,000 warranty keys
- Super admin user (TSM)
- Default credentials: `superadmin@maincompany.com` / `admin123`

### Step 2: Register New Whitelabel Companies

```bash
npm run register-whitelabel
```

**Interactive prompts for:**
- Company details (name, email, phone, address)
- Key allocation (default: 1000 keys)
- Admin user details (name, email, password, user type)

### Step 3: View All Companies

```bash
npm run list-companies
```

**Shows:**
- All registered companies
- Admin users for each company
- Key allocation and usage statistics
- System summary

## 🏗️ Architecture Features

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Support
- Complete company isolation
- Independent user hierarchies per company
- Separate key allocations

### ✅ Security & Permissions
- Company-scoped data access
- Hierarchical user permissions
- JWT-based authentication
- BCrypt password hashing

### ✅ Key Management
- Allocated keys per company
- Hierarchical key distribution
- Usage tracking and audit trails

### ✅ User Hierarchy
```
Company → TSM/ASM → Sales → Distributors → Retailers
```
