## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Understanding

### Multi-Tenant Structure
Before contributing, understand our system architecture:

- **Main Company**: Your primary company managing all white-labels
- **White-Label Companies**: Independent companies with isolated data
- **Support Employees**: Users with dynamic permissions who **CANNOT** handle keys
- **Cross-Company Access**: Main company users can access all white-labels

### User Types
```
Main Company:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MAIN_OWNER (Full system access)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MAIN_EMPLOYEE (Cross-company operations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MAIN_SUPPORT_EMPLOYEE (Assigned scope, NO key operations)

White-Label Company:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHITELABEL_OWNER (Full company access)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHITELABEL_EMPLOYEE (Company operations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WHITELABEL_SUPPORT_EMPLOYEE (Limited scope, NO key operations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Legacy Hierarchy (TSM ‚Üí ASM ‚Üí Sales ‚Üí Distributors ‚Üí Retailers)
```

### Key Security Principles
- **Support employees CANNOT perform ANY key operations**
- **Company isolation must be maintained**
- **All actions must be properly audited**
- **Permission changes require proper authorization**

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Follow existing multi-tenant patterns
- Always consider company isolation in data queries
- Include proper error handling for permission denied scenarios
- Add comprehensive comments for multi-tenant logic

### Multi-Tenant Development Rules

#### 1. **Company Isolation**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - Can access any company data
const customers = await Customer.find({});

// ‚úÖ Good - Company-scoped query
const customers = await Customer.find({ companyId: user.companyId });

// ‚úÖ Better - Using service with permission check
const customers = await CustomerService.getAccessibleCustomers(userId, companyId);
```

#### 2. **Support Employee Restrictions**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - No support employee check
async function allocateKeys(fromUserId, toUserId, keyCount) {
  // ... allocation logic
}

// ‚úÖ Good - Support employee protection
async function allocateKeys(fromUserId, toUserId, keyCount) {
  const fromUser = await User.findOne({ userId: fromUserId });
  if (fromUser.userType.includes('SUPPORT_EMPLOYEE')) {
    throw new Error('Support employees cannot allocate keys');
  }
  // ... allocation logic
}
```

#### 3. **Permission Checking**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - No permission check
app.get('/api/customers/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const customer = await Customer.findOne({ customerId: req.params.id });
  res.json(customer);
});

// ‚úÖ Good - Proper permission middleware
app.get('/api/customers/:id', 
  authenticate,
  requirePermission('VIEW_CUSTOMERS'),
  ensureCompanyContext,
  async (req, res) => {
    const canAccess = await CustomerService.canAccessCustomer(req.user.userId, req.params.id);
    if (!canAccess) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
    }
    const customer = await Customer.findOne({ customerId: req.params.id });
    res.json(customer);
  }
);
```

### Commit Message Convention
Follow conventional commit format with multi-tenant context:
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(auth): add support employee permission validation
fix(multi-tenant): resolve company isolation in customer queries  
feat(support): implement dynamic permission assignment
docs(schema): update multi-tenant architecture documentation
security(keys): strengthen key operation restrictions for support employees
```

### Branch Naming
- `feature/multi-tenant-description` for multi-tenant features
- `fix/company-isolation-issue` for isolation fixes
- `security/support-employee-restrictions` for security enhancements
- `docs/multi-tenant-guide` for documentation updates

## üß™ Testing

### Test Categories

#### 1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation Tests**
```bash
# Test company isolation
npm run test:isolation

# Test cross-company access
npm run test:cross-company

# Test support employee restrictions  
npm run test:support-restrictions
```

#### 2. **Permission Tests**
```bash
# Test permission system
npm run test:permissions

# Test role-based access
npm run test:rbac

# Test support employee assignments
npm run test:assignments
```

#### 3. **Security Tests**
```bash
# Test key operation restrictions
npm run test:key-security

# Test support employee cannot escalate permissions
npm run test:permission-escalation

# Test audit trail integrity
npm run test:audit-trail
```

### Writing Tests for Multi-Tenant Features

```javascript
describe('Multi-Tenant Customer Service', () => {
  describe('Company Isolation', () => {
    it('should not allow white-label A to access white-label B customers', async () => {
      const whitelabelAUser = await createTestUser('WHITELABEL_OWNER', 'COMPANY_A');
      const whitelabelBCustomer = await createTestCustomer('COMPANY_B');
      
      const accessible = await CustomerService.canAccessCustomer(
        whitelabelAUser.userId, 
        whitelabelBCustomer.customerId
      );
      
      expect(accessible).toBe(false);
    });
  });

  describe('Support Employee Restrictions', () => {
    it('should prevent support employee from allocating keys', async () => {
      const supportEmployee = await createTestUser('MAIN_SUPPORT_EMPLOYEE');
      
      await expect(
        KeyManagementService.allocateKeys(
          supportEmployee.userId, 
          'TARGET_USER_ID', 
          100, 
          'COMPANY_ID'
        )
      ).rejects.toThrow('Support employees cannot allocate keys');
    });
  });
});
```
